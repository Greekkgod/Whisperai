# WhisperAI – Speech-to-Text Transcription App

This project is a speech-to-text transcription tool that uses OpenAI’s Whisper model to convert spoken language into written text. It provides a simple interface for users to upload audio files and receive accurate transcriptions in return.

## Project Overview

WhisperAI is built to demonstrate how large-scale pre-trained models can be integrated into real-world applications. It showcases how automatic speech recognition (ASR) can be implemented with minimal infrastructure and a clean UI.

## What It Does

- Accepts audio files from users through a web interface
- Processes the audio using OpenAI's Whisper model
- Outputs the full transcription of the audio in text format
- Supports multilingual input

## Key Features

- End-to-end audio transcription pipeline
- Streamlit-based user interface
- Language detection and multilingual transcription
- Built-in support for long audio files
- Lightweight and easily deployable on local machines

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenAI Whisper
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- PyTorch
